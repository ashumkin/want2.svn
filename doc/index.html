    <h1>
      Dante: A build tool for Delphi programs.
    </h1>
    <p>
      Dante is a build tool specifically aimed at automatically
      building Borland Delphi projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the Spring of 2001 several <a href="../dunit">DUnit</a>
      developers, includimg me, were complaining about the
      unreliability of the Make build tool on all platforms. We've just
      had some problems building <a href="../dunit">DUnit</a> with
      Make. </p>
      <p>We discussed long about how a build tool should be like, and 
      several of
      us tough that it should be like 
      <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/index.html">Ant</a>,
      the tool used in the 
      <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org">Apache-Jakarta </a>
      project. The problem with Ant 
      itself was that we thought it was too Java-centered to be useful
      in a Delphi project. 
      </p>
      <p>A group of us decided to create
      our own tool, and thus end our sufferings with Make. 
      After a short discussion, we decided that its name 
      would be Dante, and we went on to work.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Start
    </h3>
    <p>
      Chris Morris (chrismo) set up a Source Forge project for Dante
      and got authorization from his employer to contribute some useful
      source code. I built a basic framework for build projects and
      implemented script persistance using Delphi's DFM format (the one
      used for forms). We had our first working prototype by day two.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Week One
    </h3>
    <p>
      Within a week I had incorporated my SAX/XML (soon to be published here) 
      library and Dante was
      able to read scripts in XML, much like the ones used by <a
      href="http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/index.html">Ant</a>. That
      week Chris and I wrote Excec and Dcc (Delphi compile) tasks for
      Dante, and Dante became able to build itself. Chris wrote a Versioninfo
      task for Dante that would automatically increment the version number
      upon each build.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Week Two
    </h3>
    <p>
      By the end of week two I had developed a file path library
      that could handle Ant-like wildcards in a (hopefully) platform
      independent way. The library let me
      implement Copy, Move, Delete, and Touch tasks that worked very
      much like Ant's. I added 
      <a href="http://www.tu-chemnitz.de/~nomssi/paszlib.html">Nomssi Nzali's port</a>
      of 
      <a href="http://www.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/zlib/">ZLib 1.1.2</a>
      to the mix,
      and implemented the Zip task with it.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Week Three
    </h3>
    <p>
      By week three Chris had incorporated a thorough set of unit and
      external tests using the <a href="../dunit/">DUnit</a> testing
      framework, and the few bugs present were jumping out the door. Chris's 
      design enabled us to create external tests without writing a single
      line of code.
    </p>
    <p>
      That week Mike Taylor (mtaylor) started providing feedback
      on refactorings 
      that would
      make the source code more efficient and clearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the end of the week Dante was able to build DUnit using a
      fairly complex build script (see below).
    </p>

    <p>For a better view of the following scripts, you should download them
    to your hard disk and use your favorite editor; browsers will present
    the XML in ways different from the original text.
    </p>
    <p>
      A copy of the Dante <a href="dante_build.xml">build.xml</a> script
      used to build Dante itself
      be found <a href="dante_build.xml">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      A copy of the <a href="dunit_build.xml">build.xml</a> script
      used to build 
      <a href="../dunit">DUnit</a>
      distributions with Dante can be found <a
      href="dunit_build.xml">here</a>.
