    <h1>
      Dante: A build tool for Delphi programs.
    </h1>
    <p>
      Dante is a build tool specifically aimed at automatically
      building Borland Delphi projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the Spring of 2001 several <a href="../dunit">DUnit</a>
      developers, includimg me, were complaining about the
      unreliability of the Make build tool on all platforms. We've just
      had some problems building <a href="../dunit">DUnit</a> with
      Make. We discussed how a build tool should be like, and we all
      liked <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/index.html">Ant</a>,
      the tool used in the Apache-Jakarta project, except that it was
      too Java specific for a Delphi programmer. We decided to create
      our own tool and name it Dante.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Start
    </h3>
    <p>
      Chris Morris (chrismo) set up a Source Forge project for Dante
      and got authorization from his employer to contribute some useful
      source code. I built a basic framework for build projects and
      implemented script persistance using Delphi's DFM format (the one
      used for forms). We had our first working prototype by day two.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Week One
    </h3>
    <p>
      Within a week I had incorporated my SAX/XML library and Dante was
      able to read build.xml scripts, much like the ones used by <a
      href="http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/index.html">Ant</a>. That
      week Chris and I wrote Excec and Dcc (Delphi compile) tasks for
      Dante, and Dante became able to build itself.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Week Two
    </h3>
    <p>
      By the end of week two I had incorporated a file path library
      that could handle Ant-like wildcards. The library let me
      implement Copy, Move, Delete, and Touch tasks that worked very
      much like Ant's. I added third party libraries for handling .ZIP
      files and was able to implement the Zip task.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Week Three
    </h3>
    <p>
      By week three Chris had incorporated an thorough set of unit and
      external tests using the <a href="../dunit/">DUnit</a> testing
      framework, and the few bugs were jumping out the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      That week Mike Taylor started working on refactorings that would
      make the source code more efficient and clearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the end of the week Dante was able to build DUnit using a
      fairly complex build script.
    </p>

      used to build DUnit distributions with Dante can be found <a
